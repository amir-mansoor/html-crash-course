# HTML (Hypertext Markup Language)

HTML is a markup language used for creating the structure and content of web pages. It provides a set of tags that define the elements and their relationships within a document.

## Basic Structure

An HTML document follows a basic structure:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Page Title</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <!-- Content goes here -->
  </body>
</html>

    <!DOCTYPE html>: Specifies the HTML version being used.
    <html>: The root element of an HTML page.
    <head>: Contains meta information and the title of the document.
    <title>: Defines the title displayed in the browser's title bar.
    <body>: Contains the visible content of the page.


<h3>Tags and Elements</h3>

HTML tags are used to mark up different parts of a document. Here are some commonly used tags:

    <h1> to <h6>: Headings of different levels.
    <p>: Paragraph.
    <a>: Anchor for creating links.
    <img>: Image.
    <ul>: Unordered list.

<h3>Attributes</h3>
HTML tags can have attributes that provide additional information. Some common attributes include:

    class: Specifies a CSS class for styling.
    id: Identifies a unique element.
    src: Specifies the source URL for elements like images and videos.
